# Patch Generation Variables
downSampleLevels: [1] # Downsampling factor relative to max (typically 20X). So 4 will give the 5X image. Adding multiple values gives patches at different scales
patchSizeList: [224] # Patch size (we assume patches are square) in pixels. Specify patch size separately for each scale in downSampleLevels
showProgress: True
maxPatchesPerAnno: 2500 # Maximum number of patches sampled from an annotation10000
maxAvgPatchOverlap: 2.0 # How tightly patches are allowed to overlap. 0 implies no overlap, 1 implies number of patches is selected so that combined area of patches= area of annotation
minFracPatchInAnno: 0.99 # What percentage of the patch must belong to same class as the center pixel, for the patch to be considered
