# Data and Model Generation Parameters
regenerateData: False #Warning: Changing this to True will overwrite all models and data
regeneratePatchData: False #Warning: Changing this to True will overwrite all patch data

#Patch Generation Parameters
classDict: {'BG':0,'WM':1, 'CTX':2} #Classes for classification
distinguishAnnosInClass: False #If False, all annotations of the same class are treated as one, and sampling is performed from this
downSampleLevels: [1] # Downsampling factor relative to max (typically 20X). So 4 will give the 5X image.
patchSizeList: [256] #Pixel size of patches to be used for model training
maskDownSampleFactor: 1 # How much smaller is the mask. Leads to big speed ups, but loss of resolution, which is acceptable at tumor level
showProgress: True #Display patch generation progress
maxPatchesPerAnno: 5000 # Maximum number of patches sampled from an annotation
maxAvgPatchOverlap: 1000.0 # How tightly patches are allowed to overlap. 0 implies no overlap, 1 implies number of patches is selected so that combined area of patches= area of annotation
minFracPatchInAnno: 0 # What percentage of the patch must belong to same class as the center pixel, for the patch to be considered


#Segmentation parameter
minArea: 1000 #minimum area for region segmentation
